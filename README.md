# Machine-Learning
Project from Practical Machine Learning Course in Coursera Data Science Specialisation

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which a participant does the Weight Lifting Exercise; using sensors on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell.

This would be useful to assess and provide feedback to an athlete on how to correct mistakes in during weight lifting exercises. This is and area called qualitative activity recognition.
